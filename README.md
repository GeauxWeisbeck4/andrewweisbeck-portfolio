# Andrew Weisbeck's Portfolio Site

Welcome to my new portfolio website, created with the [astro-cody-theme by kirontoo](https://github.com/kirontoo/astro-theme-cody). You will find a portfolio of the projects I have created over the years, both for personal and professional purposes. I chose this theme because it is a nice looking and basic design that serves its purpose - to showcase my work and market myself to employers.

Please note - this is only a temporary portfolio website solution. I am currently working on a portfolio website from scratch using Astro so I can showcase my design and coding skills, but I needed to have a personal portfolio up and in the public eye in the meantime while I search for work. I will share progress on my portfolio website as I work on it.
