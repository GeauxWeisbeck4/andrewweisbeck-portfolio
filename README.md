# Andrew Weisbeck's Portfolio Site

Welcome to my new portfolio website, created with the [astro-cody-theme by kirontoo](https://github.com/kirontoo/astro-theme-cody). You will find a portfolio of the projects I have created over the years, both for personal and professional purposes. I chose this theme because it is a nice looking and basic design that serves its purpose - to showcase my work and market myself to employers.

This site is still being designed and customized to my liking, I just wanted to get the project out there so I could start writing in my dev journal, sharing projects, and having a personal site. 

Any feedback is appreciated.
