This project is probably the most important project I have worked on as of late - my portfolio that showcases my skills as a developer and who I am both professionally and personally. This is the third rendition of my portfolio and I think it is the most beautiful version.

I used a template from Astro as a temporary solution while I work on building out my official version from scratch like a real developer does. I needed something to quickly show employers what I am capable of and this template is the perfect solution for just that.

I really like this projects section for showcasing my work. The layout is cool and I love that the icons for the tech stack displays so neatly. 

The blog section is going to include posts about projects and coding interview problems that I am working on. It will serve as my main place to write about coding while I work on a different project for my writing, my digital garden.

I will keep you updated on what is coming in the future for this project!
