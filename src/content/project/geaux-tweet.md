Geaux Tweet is a Twitter clone that was created with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. It showcases my ability to put together a full stack application and it uses Supabase as a PostgreSQL database and works with GitHub and Supabase for user authentication.

I learned how to use Supabase to create PostgreSQL RLS policies, create and store "tweets" using a PostgreSQL database, and hook up a front end with Next.js to a backend like Supabase. The front end was styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and sleek UI.

I need to fix the authentication part of the app as I can't seem to get a different GitHub account to login, but I will update this project once I am able to debug everything and allow you to login and try it out!
