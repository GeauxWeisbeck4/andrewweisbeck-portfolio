Working alone is difficult in a lot of ways. One thing that I have found challenging when you are not working with anyone is that you have to be productive with nobody pushing you to stay focused and to help bring your attention back to your job. When you have ADHD, it becomes a real problem and it actually was bad enough in the past that I have had to figure out creative ways to keep myself focused.

One idea that I've decided that could be helpful is working in public. This may provide some extra accountability for myself as I care about people thinking I'm not full of shit. 

To hold myself accountable I am going to start sharing my personal productivity process so if you want to, can help me with staying on task by making me think that you will make fun of me if I don't do what I'm supposed to. Honestly, it is just a good practice for me to make sure I actually go through my full process and don't shortchange myself on something that has helped me a lot.

## Personal Agile and Productivity Process

So I operate in two-week sprint intervals and I am on the fourth sprint since I started this process this year. I like to plan each week separately because it helps me focus on that week and not get ahead of myself. The first week is more for starting projects and the second week is for finishing them, in theory. In reality, it doesn't work like that at all but I at least try.

## Sprint Four, Week One Planning

So this is how I am going to do it for now.

### Projects

- Django College Football Blog
  - I don't have a name for this one yet, but I created a blog by following Django by Example and it is going to be my blog about college football. All that is left for this week is styling, writing, and deploying the app.
- Tar Heel Dev Studio Website Development Version 3
  - This is my third redesign of this website. It's not because I hate the old design, but my situation the last 20 months made it so I couldn't maintain my freelance business like I wanted to for quite a while so I felt like I need a fresh start. Start the project this week, get the site out there, and start marketing.
- GeauxWeisbeck4.dev
  - That is this website! There is some UI design work I want to do as well as content things like adding recent projects and more blog posts.
- Django By Example Apps
  - Build the apps out of this book.
- Roadmap.sh Backend and Frontend Projects
  - I want to build these projects for my portfolio, but on camera for YouTube. I think it would be a neat content project to do.

### Content
- WeisMind First Post
  - I need to publish my first post - well also write it. Look out for it on Thursday most likely
- Geaux Code Posts
  - I want to start getting posts out every other day but likely can't get to this till the end of the week
- Dev.to Blog Posts
  - Same deal as Geaux Code
- Dev Journal (This Site)
  - Need to write about what I'm doing daily and more posts about web development.
- CFB Blog
  - Write posts about college football

### Stories
- [ ] Deploy Django CFB Blog and create content. Track results and report on it at the end of the week.
- [ ] Track productivity to see what I can improve on at the end of the week
- [ ] Make the UI a little bit more the way I want to have it look for this website.
- [ ] Finish blog posts that need to be done as prioritized on Asana
- [ ] Start planning out my productivity app I want to build.

## Time to Work!

I really have a lot to do so I need to get on my grind. This is pretty bare I know, but it's something for now. I plan on using the Asana API to share my sprint stuff either on my digital garden or on this site soon. Thanks for reading and check in to see how this week went!
