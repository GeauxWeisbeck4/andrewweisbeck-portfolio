Today I am starting my developer journal, a new practice that I hope will help me reinforce what I learn each day as well as help others learn from my own programming experiences. There's nothing really too crazy about it, but the idea is to reflect on what was learned on that day, review of programming problems that I worked on, updates on progress on various topics, and also sharing my weekly sprint updates and reflections on projects.
