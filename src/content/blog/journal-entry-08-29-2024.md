Today I am starting my developer journal, a new practice that I hope will help me reinforce what I learn each day as well as help others learn from my own programming experiences. There's nothing really too crazy about it, but the idea is to reflect on what was learned on that day, review of programming problems that I worked on, updates on progress on various topics, and also sharing my weekly sprint updates and reflections on projects.

Rather than continue talking about what it will look like, I think it would be best for me to show you what my daily entries will look like. ☺️

## Thursday - August 29, 2024

So usually I will probably have a brief summary of the day here and dive into some structured things like:

### Things I Found 
- **DoltHub** - Git for SQL Databases. This is actually a really cool product and I am drafting up a blog post about it.

### Today I Learned
- There is a new Supabase book and it is really good.
- That some people are straight up greedy and don't really care about you getting better, but they really just care about getting your money.

### Coding Problems/Tips/Concepts From Today
- This could be something like:
  - How to write code for a dev blog post


```javacript
const add = (a, b) => a + b
add(2, 2)
// 4
```

### Sprint 3 Week One
- Stuff about my current sprint will go here as well. Stuff like:
  - Tasks that I've completed
  - Tasks that I still need to do
  - Things to do in the upcoming week

### Final Thoughts
- I think this could be a helpful practice for me myself as well as other developers and potential employers. You'll get to know me and also get to learn a few new things that I've been learning myself.
