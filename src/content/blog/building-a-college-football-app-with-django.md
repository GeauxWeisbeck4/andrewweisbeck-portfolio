I've been a college football nut for as long as I can remember. Some of my favorite memories from my youth were watching all the games on Saturdays, especially the Nebraska Cornhusker games. I would watch the game and in between half and commercials, would run outside and play football with the neighbors, and if they weren't there I would just play football by myself against an imaginary field of other players.

## Why Build a College Football App?

There's been a lot of ideas that have come through my brain - a Fediverse blogging app, a blog for every team in the major conferences, and even an Air BnB type app except replace homes with tailgating spots. The only one that ever fully came to fruition was [Husker JS](https://huskerjs.netlify.app/), which is in sore need of some love and attention. 

The idea that finally clicked was this idea - a college football storytelling app that will feature daily polls for users, a micro-blogging or forum section for members, and a boatload of data on college football with blog posts that use data, excellent writing, and visuals to tell the story of college football.

Being an unofficial college football historian and a full stack web developer, I am in the perfect position to create my dream application. Since I haven't used Django in quite some time, I decided to go through their introductory tutorial to build the poll app of the website and have a good place to start. With the poll app as a good starting point, I am going to write about planning the app, designing the architecture, and creating the actual code for the website.
