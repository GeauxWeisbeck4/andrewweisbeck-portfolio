I've been a college football nut for as long as I can remember. Some of my favorite memories from my youth were watching all the games on Saturdays, especially the Nebraska Cornhusker games. I would watch the game and in between half and commercials, would run outside and play football with the neighbors, and if they weren't there I would just play football by myself against an imaginary field of other players.

## A College Football App Built With Django

I can't really think of a better iea for a side project than building a college football blogging application so I can tell the story of college football as I see it. I'll start out by blogging about this season while I build other features into the app and see what users like and don't like. The main concept to focus on will be the storytelling features of the app so obviously, blogging will be the most important thing to get functioning and optimized.

A pretty straightforward concept and implementation here. Get people to use the site via content and college football content is always something that you can differentiate in many different ways. I want to make my app special by using code to tell my story in a unique way. Talk about the history of college football with cool timelines and images. Recap games with charts to show important statistics and it would be cool if I can get artsy with some visual stuff as well. There's a whole lot of different ways this could go and I am excited to try out and implement some of my ideas.

## Potential Next Steps

I've got the blog built, but the site layout isn't great because I'm mainly getting everything functional as of now with Django. I have some features I'd like to add to the blog and I need to style the site as well. I'm also going to likely be adding JavaScript to the front end so I need to decided if I'm going to use a framework or anything before I go to crazy on styling everything. 

As far as major features go, I know I will want to add polls pretty early on as that is an interactive feature that could drive up engagement with the site and make users enjoy using the app more than just a generic blog. That will be great for terms of data collection and polls are always a great way to tell a story, especially when the users of your app are the ones actually voting in the polls. They will tune in to hear the results explained - good stuff.

I need to deploy the site as well, but like I said, I want at least some decent enough styling so that people will want to visit the site. I also need to get SEO going right away, so I gotta do some research on Django SEO packages or whatever else I need.

## Stay Tuned For More

I will be sharing more as I deploy the site and add features. You will definitely be able to find it on my projects page here, so keep checking in if you are curious about this project.
