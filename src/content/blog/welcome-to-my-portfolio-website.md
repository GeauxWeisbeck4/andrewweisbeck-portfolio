Welcome to the third edition of Andrew Weisbeck's portfolio website! I am excited to share the latest version of the website that I've created to share my coding work with the world. I am working on creating a version completely from scratch, but this starter template I found from Astro is a great placeholder until I can work on something that is completely mine. 

The reason I chose to use a template rather than share a portfolio I've created from scratch is that I needed something that I can quickly use to showcase my work for potential employers and clients. My first two versions of my portfolio website were created from scratch, but they both took lots of time and planning. 

My domain expired on my previous portfolio (plus I just wasn't thrilled with the design of my site), so I figured that was a good sign to create a new website to showcase my work.

## Just Getting Started

While I am excited to share this very first version of this website, I must let you know that there is still a lot of work to be done on this website. For example, I want to showcase my skills with a progress bar that shows my level of experience and knowledge on each skill that also displays an icon of the skill or technology displayed. Another feature I want to add is a page that lists out the services I offer as a freelance web developer.

There is still much work to be done on this project, but I hope it serves as an adequate portfolio website in the meantime. Please reach out if you have any comments or questions in regard to this project. Thank you and I hope you enjoy this site!
